**The Interaction – HCI Detailed Notes**

**What is Interaction?**
- Interaction is the dynamic communication between a human user and a computer system.
- It is not just input and output; it involves understanding, intention, and feedback throughout the process.
- Interaction occurs in direct forms (real-time dialogue with feedback) and indirect forms (automated or batch operations).
- Effective interaction design ensures users can achieve their goals efficiently, safely, and comfortably.

**Models of Interaction**
- Interaction models help understand how users communicate with systems.
- Key Terms:
  1. Domain: The specific area of work or activity (e.g., graphic design or data entry).
  2. Goal: The desired outcome or objective (e.g., create a red triangle).
  3. Task: The set of actions or operations needed to achieve the goal (e.g., select fill tool → click triangle).
- Interaction models bridge the gap between user expectations and system functionality.
- Clear definition of tasks, goals, and domains helps in designing more intuitive interfaces.

**Donald Norman’s Model**
- Norman’s model concentrates on user’s view of the interface
- Seven stages of interaction:
  1. user establishes the goal
  2. formulates intention
  3. specifies actions at interface
  4. executes action
  5. perceives system state
  6. interprets system state
  7. evaluates system state with respect to goal

- Gulf of Execution: When system actions do not match user intentions.
- Gulf of Evaluation: When system feedback does not align with user expectations.

**Abowd & Beale Framework**
- An extension of Norman’s model.
- Components: User, Input, System, Output – each has a distinct language or representation.
- Interaction is a translation process between these languages, mapping intentions to system responses.
- Helps identify interaction problems as issues in translation between user and system.
- General framework applicable to all interactive systems, not just computers, enabling comparison of usability and design effectiveness.
- Translation Example:
  - User intention → Translated into system actions → Changes system state → Reflected in output → Interpreted by the user.

**Ergonomics (Human Factors)**
- Study of the physical characteristics of interaction
- Also known as human factors
- Ergonomics sets clear rules and guidelines for how we design systems.

**Examples of Ergonomics in HCI:**
1. Controls & Displays: Arranged logically by function, frequency, or sequence for ease of use.
2. Environmental Factors: Adjustable seating, lighting, and temperature for diverse user needs.
3. Health & Safety: Proper posture, reduced strain, noise control, and illumination management.
4. Use of Color: Red for warnings, green for safe actions, considering color-blindness.
