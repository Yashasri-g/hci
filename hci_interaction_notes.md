**The Interaction – HCI Detailed Notes**

**What is Interaction?**
- Interaction is the dynamic communication between a human user and a computer system.
- It is not just input and output; it involves understanding, intention, and feedback throughout the process.
- Interaction occurs in direct forms (real-time dialogue with feedback) and indirect forms (automated or batch operations).
- Effective interaction design ensures users can achieve their goals efficiently, safely, and comfortably.

**Models of Interaction**
- Interaction models help abstract and understand how users communicate with systems.
- Key Terms:
  1. Domain: The specific area of work or activity (e.g., graphic design or data entry).
  2. Goal: The desired outcome or objective (e.g., create a red triangle).
  3. Task: The set of actions or operations needed to achieve the goal (e.g., select fill tool → click triangle).
- Interaction models bridge the gap between user expectations and system functionality.
- Clear definition of tasks, goals, and domains helps in designing more intuitive interfaces.

**Donald Norman’s Model**
- Norman’s model explains user cognition and behavior when interacting with systems.
- Seven stages of interaction:
  1. User establishes the goal they want to achieve.
  2. Formulates intention for the required actions.
  3. Specifies actions to be executed at the interface.
  4. Executes the planned action.
  5. Perceives the system response or state.
  6. Interprets what the system output means.
  7. Evaluates whether the outcome matches the original goal.
- Highlights user-centered perspective, showing potential mismatches between user expectations and system behavior.
- Gulf of Execution: When system actions do not match user intentions.
- Gulf of Evaluation: When system feedback does not align with user expectations.

**Abowd & Beale Framework**
- An extension of Norman’s model, providing a formal framework for understanding interactions.
- Components: User, Input, System, Output – each has a distinct language or representation.
- Interaction is a translation process between these languages, mapping intentions to system responses.
- Helps identify interaction problems as issues in translation between user and system.
- General framework applicable to all interactive systems, not just computers, enabling comparison of usability and design effectiveness.
- Translation Example:
  - User intention → Translated into system actions → Changes system state → Reflected in output → Interpreted by the user.

**Ergonomics (Human Factors)**
- Ergonomics is the study of physical and physiological aspects of human interaction with systems.
- Focuses on user comfort, safety, and efficiency, optimizing system layout and environmental conditions.
- Provides design standards and guidelines for interfaces, controls, and displays.
- Considers long-term health and performance, including posture, repetitive strain prevention, and workspace adaptation.
- Ergonomics ensures users can interact intuitively without fatigue or error.

**Examples of Ergonomics in HCI:**
1. Controls & Displays: Arranged logically by function, frequency, or sequence for ease of use.
2. Environmental Factors: Adjustable seating, lighting, and temperature for diverse user needs.
3. Health & Safety: Proper posture, reduced strain, noise control, and illumination management.
4. Use of Color: Red for warnings, green for safe actions, considering color-blindness.
5. User-Centric Design: Equipment and interface designed for comfort and intuitive operation.
